# Node READme Generator
This READme generator was made using JavaScript, node.js, and the node package manager Inquirer. Inquirer allowed questions to be formatted and how the answers were recieved. The standard node library was used to create the new READme files. This project was completed so that people would have a quick and easy way to generate a quality READme file. By using the terminal to answer questions, a new file is generated and ready for use.
